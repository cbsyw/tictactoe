create game board (handles gameboard, game inputs)
    - make board 
    - handle input (player and location)
    - check available positions
        if position is available place marker in selected location
    -   if selection not available, no reaction
    - maybe not necessary, just need a good if/else statement so that location is correct
    print new board (does not work, bc switches the order of array, just creates new array...)
    
    *** make the input handle correctly *** 
        currently just turns into value instantly  


create player system (handles player inputs, interracts with gameboard,switches turn)
    - player chooses input (that is the location)
    - input and player name go to gameboard
    - once done switch player

create game controller (handles game round, accounts for score and win criteria)
    - initiate game board and player system
    - account for win case
    - if win case met - break print 'player x wins'
    - else return 'tie play again'
     












plan:

make gameboard
- function that creates the gameboard (3*3) for tictactoe
- function that gives the available sections
    - filters for which spots are available (which are equal to zero)
    - if the spot = 0 then it is valid
    - 
- function that returns if selection not available
- function that takes player and selection and enters them on to table
- return table
- print table (for console use)

make cell sections
-1 = player one tic, 2 = player two tic, 0 = no tic in section


make game controller

make player selection and switch
- function that accepts player and selection
- lists player and 'their turn'
- function that takes player and selection, switches after selection
- function that puts this player and selection into gameboard


make round print and next round
- result of round is printed and stored
- round is called again
- function that accounts for all win cases
